### Example of making a full screen view with iOS 7+

Modern iOS 7 apps make use of the new features of the top bars which include the status and 
navigation bar. These bars can be colored the same so they blend together and can also be
set to be totally clear. A good interaction which allows for maximizing the full screen of
the iOS screen is to hide and show the top bars according to the content offset of the scroll
view. In this sample application there are two examples with different styles of maximizing
the space for the content while adjusting the top bars.

The first screen has the top bar set with a clear background with a darker blue header view
in the scroll view. When the scroll view moves up the top bars are hidden and a custom top
view is shown.

The second screen displays a photo behind the top bars and when scrolled up to the bottom
of the photo the background for the top bars is made opaque to the photo and text behind 
the top bars does not clash with the buttons, title and status bar which is still visible.
